            <p>
                I was born in Duluth, Minnesota, on the head of Lake Superior, and I have spent much of my life there. I have worked in politics,
                chemistry, and aquatic toxicology. My academic background is in history, biochemistry, and mathematics. I
                am currently a full-stack web developer based in Denver.</p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include being ouside hiking, biking, and running. I also thoroughly enjoy music, both consuming and creating.
                My preferred instrument for creation is piano, and I will occasionally pick up a ukulele. With the rest of
                my time, I
                <strong>enjoy</strong> geeking out with machine learning and math.
